# Audio Separator

A powerful Python tool for separating audio tracks into individual components (vocals, accompaniment, etc.) and enhancing vocal tracks using advanced signal processing techniques. This project uses the Spleeter library for source separation and implements custom vocal enhancement using spectral gating and multi-band processing.it can also use in while movie dubbing, we can use this to audio processing etc.

## Features

Audio Separator provides a robust set of features for audio processing:

- Separate audio tracks into multiple stems (vocals, accompaniment, drums, bass)
- Support for multiple separation models (2-stem, 4-stem, 5-stem)
- Advanced vocal enhancement using multi-band spectral gating
- Configurable noise reduction parameters
- Support for various audio formats (MP3, WAV, FLAC, OGG, M4A)
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Command-line interface for easy integration

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip package manager
- FFmpeg (required for audio processing)

### Installing FFmpeg

#### Windows
1. Download FFmpeg from [FFmpeg official website](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)
2. Add FFmpeg to your system PATH

#### Linux
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
```

#### macOS
```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```

### Installing Audio Separator

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/audio-separator.git
cd audio-separator
```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install spleeter librosa soundfile numpy
```

If you encounter issues installing Spleeter, try:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/deezer/spleeter
```

## Usage

### Command Line Interface

Basic usage:
```bash
python audio_separator.py --input "input.mp3" --output-dir "output" --model "2stems"
```

With vocal enhancement:
```bash
python audio_separator.py --input "input.mp3" --output-dir "output" --model "2stems" --enhance-vocals --noise-reduction 0.3
```

### Available Commands

```
--input          Input audio file path (required)
--output-dir     Output directory path (required)
--model          Model type for separation (2stems, 4stems, 5stems)
--prefix         Optional prefix for output filenames
--enhance-vocals Apply vocal enhancement
--noise-reduction Noise reduction strength (0.0 to 1.0)
```

### Python API

You can also use Audio Separator in your Python code:

```python
from audio_separator import AudioSeparator

# Initialize the separator
separator = AudioSeparator(model_type='2stems')

# Separate audio
separated_files = separator.separate_audio(
    'input.mp3',
    'output_directory',
    'optional_prefix'
)

# Enhance vocals
separator.enhance_vocals(
    separated_files['vocals'],
    'output_directory/enhanced_vocals.wav',
    noise_reduction_strength=0.3
)
```

## Technical Details

### Supported Models

- `2stems`: Separates into vocals and accompaniment
- `4stems`: Separates into vocals, drums, bass, and other
- `5stems`: Separates into vocals, drums, bass, piano, and other

### Vocal Enhancement

The vocal enhancement process uses:
- Multi-band spectral gating
- Frequency-dependent thresholding
- Signal normalization
- Minimal signal retention to prevent artifacts

### Supported Audio Formats

- MP3 (.mp3)
- WAV (.wav)
- FLAC (.flac)
- OGG (.ogg)
- M4A (.m4a)

3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

## Error Handling

The tool includes comprehensive error handling for common issues:
- Invalid input file formats
- Missing input files
- Network connectivity issues
- Processing errors
- Resource cleanup

Error messages are logged with detailed information to help diagnose issues.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Spleeter Installation Fails**
   ```bash
   pip install git+https://github.com/deezer/spleeter
   ```
   or try using conda:
   ```bash
   conda install -c conda-forge spleeter
   ```

2. **FFmpeg Not Found**
   - Ensure FFmpeg is installed and added to your system PATH
   - Verify installation: `ffmpeg -version`

3. **Memory Issues**
   - Try processing smaller audio files
   - Use the 2stems model which requires less memory
   - Increase your system's swap space

### Getting Help

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the [Issues](https://github.com/yourusername/audio-separator/issues) page
2. Search for similar problems in closed issues
3. Open a new issue with:
   - Your system information
   - Complete error message
   - Steps to reproduce the problem

## Roadmap

Future improvements planned:
- GPU acceleration support
- Additional enhancement algorithms
- Batch processing capabilities
- Web interface
- Docker container support
