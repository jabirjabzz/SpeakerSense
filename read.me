# SpeakerSense

##Project Description
SpeakerSense is a machine learning project designed for detection and identificatton. this project uses various machine learning algorithms, Such as deep learning to recognize and classify different speakers based on audio features extractedfrom vouce recordings.

##Features
-Speaker Identification: Detect and classify multiple speakers from a single audio file.
-Audio Preprocessing: Feature extraction from raw audio data.
-Modeling: Using deep learning for voice recognition and speaker detection.
